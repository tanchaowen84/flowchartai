# How to Create a Flowchart in Excel (2025)

If you need to create a flowchart in Excel, you’ve got three reliable options:

- Create a flowchart in Excel with shapes and connectors (manual, precise)
- Create a flowchart in Excel with SmartArt (fast for simple processes)
- Create a flowchart in Excel with the Visio Data Visualizer add-in (data-driven, refreshable)

This step-by-step guide shows each method and when to use it. All instructions are verified against Microsoft Support pages to keep everything accurate.

## Option 1 — Create a flowchart in Excel using Shapes and Connectors

Best for: precise layout control inside Excel without add-ins.

1) Insert flowchart shapes
- Excel > Insert > Shapes > Flowchart category (Terminal, Process, Decision, Data, etc.)
- Draw a shape and type your step text

2) Connect shapes correctly
- Insert > Shapes > pick a Connector (straight/angled/curved), not a plain line
- Drag from a shape’s connection point to another shape’s connection point
- Format arrowheads/weight/color via Shape Format > Shape Outline

3) Keep your Excel flowchart tidy
- Use Align and Distribute (Shape Format > Align)
- Group related steps (Cmd/Ctrl + G) to move them together
- Use Decision (diamond) only for yes/no branching

Microsoft references:
- Draw or delete a line or connector — https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/draw-or-delete-a-line-or-connector-f304ef73-9514-450b-9bb9-28c6057020f2

Pros
- Full control over flowchart layout and styling inside Excel
- No add-in or sign-in needed

Cons
- Edits get slow on large Excel flowcharts
- Not data-linked; no one-click refresh from a table

### Efficiency tips  
- Toggle *Snap to Grid* and *Snap to Shape* (Page Layout ► Arrange ► Align ► **Snap To**) to keep connectors clean.  
- Use **Alt + Arrow keys** for fine‑grained nudge; hold **Shift** for 10‑pixel jumps.  
- Quickly align multiple shapes with **Alt + H,A,C** (Center), **Alt + H,A,M** (Middle), or distribute them with **Alt + H,A,I** (Distribute Horizontally).  
- Press **Cmd/Ctrl + G** to group, then hold **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + G** to ungroup when you need to edit.

## Option 2 — Create a flowchart in Excel with SmartArt

Best for: quick, simple Excel flowcharts with minimal branching.

1) Insert SmartArt
- Insert > SmartArt > Process category (e.g., Basic Process)
- Enter each step’s text; use Add Shape to extend the flow

2) Restyle quickly
- SmartArt Design/Format tabs let you switch layout, colors, and styles
- Great for a clean, presentable Excel flowchart in minutes

Microsoft references:
- Create a flow chart with SmartArt — https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-flow-chart-with-smartart-30f87402-ba3d-48c8-8e9f-a66bcee7e5aa

Pros
- Fastest way to create a flowchart in Excel
- Easy global styling changes

Cons
- Limited branching/connector control
- Not ideal for complex Excel flowcharts or swimlanes

### Efficiency tips  
- Use **SmartArt Design ► Add Shape Before/After** to re‑sequence steps without dragging.  
- Apply a new color theme via **SmartArt Design ► Change Colors** for one‑click brand alignment.  
- Convert SmartArt to shapes (Right‑click ► *Convert to Shapes*) when you need extra connector flexibility.

## Option 3 — Create a flowchart in Excel with the Visio Data Visualizer add-in

Best for: structured, refreshable Excel flowcharts generated from a table (also supports cross-functional flowcharts and org charts).

What it is
- An Excel add-in that reads a structured data table and automatically draws a Visio flowchart inside Excel
- Supports Basic Flowchart, Cross-Functional Flowchart (swimlanes), and Org Chart
- You can refresh the diagram after editing the Excel table; with Visio Plan 2 you can push changes back (two-way sync)

### Availability & licensing (verified)  
| Plan | Included with | Create diagrams | Basic web edits | Advanced edits & two‑way sync | Monthly price* |  
| ---- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |  
| **Visio in Microsoft 365** | M365 commercial & edu | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ | Included |  
| **Visio Plan 1** | Add‑on | ✔️ | ✔️ (web only) | ❌ | ~$5 USD |  
| **Visio Plan 2** | Add‑on | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ (desktop + web) | ~$15 USD |  

\*Indicative US pricing; see Microsoft site for your region.

> **Browser note**: the add‑in requires third‑party cookies enabled; otherwise the diagram canvas remains blank.

> **Language note**: UI is currently English‑only (as of August 2025).

Step-by-step (Excel flowchart from a table)
1) Install the add-in
- Excel > Insert > Get Add-ins (Office Add-ins) > search “Data Visualizer” > Add
- Sign in with your Microsoft 365 work or school account

2) Insert a template
- Choose Basic Flowchart or Cross-Functional Flowchart template in the Data Visualizer pane
- Excel inserts a sample diagram plus a linked data table

3) Understand required columns for a flowchart
- Process step ID: unique ID (e.g., P100)
- Process step description: visible text shown on each shape
- Next step ID: next step’s ID; use comma for branching (e.g., P200,P300)
- Connector label: labels for each branch in order (e.g., Yes,No)
- Shape type: select Process, Decision, etc.
- Function/Phase: used by cross-functional flowcharts only
- Alt text: accessibility text (recommended)

4) Build your Excel flowchart logic in the table
- Add/remove rows for steps; update Next step ID to connect the flow
- Click Refresh in the diagram container to regenerate the flowchart

5) Edit and share
- Open in web to view/print/share in Visio for the web
- Basic web edits need Visio Plan 1/2; two-way sync needs Visio Plan 2 (edit in desktop Visio, then Update Source Data to push changes back to Excel)

Tips & caveats
- Save to OneDrive/SharePoint for best interoperability
- If add-ins are disabled by admin, ask for centralized deployment
- Cookies must be enabled for the add-in

### When to switch to Visio full‑fledged editing  
If your diagram exceeds **50 shapes**, spans **3 + swimlanes**, or needs auto‑routing & data graphics, open it in the Visio desktop app for faster layout and advanced formatting.

## Which Excel flowchart method should you choose?

- “I need a quick, simple flowchart in Excel”: use SmartArt
- “I want full layout control in Excel without add-ins”: use Shapes + Connectors
- “I need a structured, refreshable Excel flowchart with swimlanes”: use Visio Data Visualizer
- “I need advanced diagramming beyond Excel”: use Visio directly (web or desktop)

## Practical examples

Create a flowchart in Excel with shapes (example)
1) Insert > Shapes > Process; type “Start checkout”
2) Insert > Shapes > Decision; type “Payment success?”
3) Connect using angled connector lines (Insert > Shapes > Connector)
4) Add “Yes” branch to “Confirmation”; add “No” branch to “Retry payment”

Create a SmartArt flowchart in Excel (example)
1) Insert > SmartArt > Process > Basic Process
2) Add steps: “Start” → “Add to cart” → “Checkout” → “Payment” → “Confirmation”
3) Change Colors / Styles for a polished look

Create a flowchart in Excel with Data Visualizer (example)
1) Insert the “Basic Flowchart” template from Data Visualizer
2) Fill table rows (P100 Start, P200 Add to cart, P300 Checkout, P400 Payment, P500 Confirmation)
3) Set Next step ID (e.g., P100→P200→P300→P400; Decision splits to P500 or back to P300)
4) Refresh the diagram to update your Excel flowchart automatically

## FAQ: Excel flowcharts (verified)

- Do I need Visio to create a flowchart in Excel?
  - No. You can create a diagram with the Data Visualizer add-in without owning Visio. For editing beyond the table and for two-way sync, you need Visio (Plan 1 for basic web edits; Plan 2 for advanced desktop edits + two-way sync).

- Does the add-in work on Mac and web?
  - Yes. Data Visualizer works on Excel for Microsoft 365 (Windows/Mac) and Excel for the web.

- Is my flowchart data stored online?
  - The add-in uses a secure online service to generate diagrams but doesn’t store your data in the Microsoft cloud. An internet connection is required for generation.

- Can I make cross-functional flowcharts (swimlanes) in Excel?
  - Yes. Use the Cross-Functional Flowchart template and add Function/Phase columns.

- What’s the difference between Visio Plan 1 and Plan 2?  
  - Plan 1 is web‑only: create and lightly edit diagrams in a browser. Plan 2 adds the desktop app, advanced templates, data graphics, and pushes edits back to Excel (two‑way sync).

## Conclusion: The best way to create a flowchart in Excel

To choose the *right* Excel flowchart method, weigh **speed vs. control vs. refreshability**: SmartArt is fastest, Shapes offer pixel‑perfect control, and Visio Data Visualizer is unbeatable for large, refreshable diagrams—especially once you outgrow ~50 shapes.

If you want maximum control, build your Excel flowchart with shapes and connectors. For speed, SmartArt is the quickest option. If you need a refreshable, structured flowchart in Excel (including swimlanes) with the option to upgrade into advanced editing, the Visio Data Visualizer add-in is the best long-term choice.

When your process gets large or complex, consider switching from an Excel flowchart to a dedicated diagram tool for faster layout, better auto-routing, and richer templates.
