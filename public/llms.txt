# FlowChart AI — Site Overview

FlowChart AI turns plain-language ideas into clear, editable flowcharts. Type a description, get a professional diagram, then refine with drag-and-drop, styling, and full undo/redo. Personal workspaces keep versions traceable, exports cover PNG / SVG / Excalidraw (PDF planned), and multilingual/mobile-friendly UX makes sharing easy. Image-to-flowchart is now available: upload one picture to obtain an editable diagram. A free tier offers a daily taste; paid or self-hosted setups can remove practical limits.

## Background
We aim to cut the effort of communicating processes so product, ops, teaching, and engineering teams can focus on decisions instead of drawing boxes. The product philosophy is “AI drafts, you refine”: AI supplies structure, users polish and keep history intact. Open-source and self-host friendly, so organizations retain data control. Current focus areas: smarter replace/extend generations, polished image-to-flowchart conversions, and clearer onboarding so teams ramp quickly.
