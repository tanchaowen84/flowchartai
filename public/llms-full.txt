# FlowChart AI — Full Site Description

FlowChart AI lets you express processes faster: describe in plain language or upload a single flow-related image, and receive a clear, editable flowchart. You can drag elements, restyle, and rely on full undo/redo. Personal workspaces keep versions traceable, exports include PNG / SVG / Excalidraw (PDF planned), and the experience is multilingual and mobile-friendly. A free tier offers daily use; paid or self-hosted deployments can operate without practical caps to suit team throughput.

## Background (Vision & Mission)
Our mission is to reduce the friction of communicating processes so product, operations, teaching, and engineering teams spend energy on decisions, not diagramming. The guiding idea is “AI drafts, you refine”: AI supplies a structured first pass, users fine-tune with full history preserved. The project is open-source and self-host friendly, giving organizations data sovereignty. Current priorities: sharper replace/extend generations to avoid overlap, production-ready image-to-flowchart journeys, and onboarding that makes new teams productive quickly.
